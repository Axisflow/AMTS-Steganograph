# AMTS Stegnography

This is a project for the paper "Steganography in RGB Images Using Adjacent Mean with Threshold Shifting."

# Example
There is complete example of embedding and extracting information in usage.ipynb.

In the settings section,set C as the carrier,
ED as the information to be embedded,
T as the threshold, and N as the number of bits embedded at each embeddable position.
